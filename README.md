# Ikea Level Design
This is a level design project assigned by my professor. My class and I were tasked to make a level biased off the idea where stores create paths to keep customers in.

## Requirements
<br><br>
Using Unreal Engine 4, you are to build a level Whitebox (or Prototype/Blocking Pass) based on the map of Houston's IKEA. The building's layout, which is two floors, is provided below. You only need to build one floor.

You'll need to use UE4's brush editing tools to build walls and floors matching the layout as closely as possible. In a future project, you'll use this as a starting point to decorate a unique map and make it your own. Be sure that you're using UE4's BSP systems (editable geometry) rather than static meshes (static meshes cannot be easily adjusted like BSPs can). Refer to the "Blocktober" link below for more information.

The goal here is to create a simple map that the player can walk around in. More than anything else at this point you should be focused on getting the scale right; make sure the player can fit through doorways, and doesn't have to jump up a set of stairs.

Once you have finished, you can upload just the .umap file of your level. Make sure that it contains your name (something like "BrandonOliveIKEA.umap"), and does not contain any spaces or special characters.

# WhiteBox Stage
The WhiteBox stage is where level designers create an initial level made out of "White Boxes" to only get the feel of how the level is going to turn out and not be impacted by the levels visuals. In this instance, our class had to use Houston Ikea's Layout to plan and make our level. We used Unreal's tools to make the white boxes.
